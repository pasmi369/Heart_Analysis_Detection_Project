# Heart_Analysis_Detection_Project

## Introduction
- Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects you‚Äôre born with (congenital heart defects), among others.

- The term ‚Äúheart disease‚Äù is often used interchangeably with the term ‚Äúcardiovascular disease‚Äù. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. 
- According to a news article, heart disease proves to be the leading cause of death for both women and men. The article states the following :
  - About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year‚Äìthat‚Äôs 1 in every 4 deaths.
  - Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men.
  - Coronary Heart Disease(CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually.
  - Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack. Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack.

## Data Citation:

File cardio_train was downloaded from Kaggle.com site.

Link:https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/

Using Python and Pandas functions, the "age" column was converted from days to year.

## Goal:
- Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with Heart Disease. This is a binary outcome.
  - Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease.
  - Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease.
 
- Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy.
- Examine trends & correlations within our data.
- Determine which features are most important to Positive/Negative Heart Disease diagnosis.

# ETL Process
### Columns to create:
  - BMI into Obesity (Calculation based on height and weight)
    - The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared. A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9.
  - Age into Age in Years 
  - Age Ranges(for ex: ([35-39],[40-44].....[65-90])
  - Group by
  - Cholesterol levels (max, min)
  - Glucose levels (max, min)
  - Activity levels (max, min)

# Machine Learning
## Models tested
The targest value counts are equal to 0: 34753 and 1: 33394. The data was split into testing and training sets with random_state=1, train_size=0.7, test_size=0.3, stratify=y. 
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier
  * ![brf_test_accuracy.png](https://github.com/pasmi369/Heart_Analysis_Detection_Project/blob/main/Resources/brf_test_accuracy.png)
* SMOTEENN

## Model Trained
Two models were chosen to optimize and train: Balanced Random Forest Classifier and SMOTE Oversampling.
### Optimization of the Model
The goal for optimizing the models was to reach at least 75% accuracy. 
* General optimization occured in editing the split between the training and the testing set.
```python
# Starting split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1, train_size=0.7, test_size=0.3, stratify=y)
# Optimization try 1.1
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, stratify=y)
# Optimization try 1.2
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1, stratify=y)
```
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier
```python
# Starting Classifier
brf_model = BalancedRandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=150, random_state=1)
# Optimization try 2.1
brf_model = BalancedRandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=175, random_state=10)
# Optimization try 2.2
brf_model = BalancedRandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, random_state=1)
```
* SMOTE Oversampling
```python
# Starting Resample
smote = SMOTE(random_state=1)
# Optimization try 3.1
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
# Optimization try 3.2
smote = SMOTE(random_state=20)
```
### Final Model Optimization Settings & Accuracy
Balanced Random Forest Classifier
 * Regaredless of the changes to the balanced random forest classifier the accuracy seems to be capped at 0.716.
 * The table below lists the top five features by importance. The feature importance did not change during the optimization.

| Percentage | Feature |
|---------|---------|
| 0.1898 | ap_hi_status_encoded_3 |
| 0.1228 | ap_lo_status_encoded_2 |
| 0.0770 | ap_hi_status_encoded_1 |
| 0.0731 | ap_hi_status_encoded_0 |
| 0.0481 | cholesterol_3 |

SMOTE Oversampling
 *  The highest accuacy for SMOTE Oversampling was 0.724 with code below. 
```python
# Optimization try 1.1
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, stratify=y)
# Starting Resample
smote = SMOTE(random_state=1)
```
## Machine Learning Conclusion
1. The optimization goal of 75% was not meet. The dataset appears to be maxed out at an accuracy of 0.716 for the Balanced Random Forest classifier and around 0.724 for SMOTE Oversampling. 
2. The most important feature in the accuracte prediction of cardiovascular desisease is ap_hi_status_encoded_3 which represents Systolic blood pressure in the high blood pressure status 2 range, this is the range before a hypertensive crisis also known as a heart attack. üîó[Reference Link for blood pressure readings](https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/blood-pressure-reading-explained)
